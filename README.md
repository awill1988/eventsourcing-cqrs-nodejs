# eventsourcing

## Overview

The following project has been created to demonstrate an attempt at a simple, pure implementation of Event Sourcing,
Domain Driven Design (DDD), Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and favors eventual consistency.

**Notes:**
- No authentication / authorization
- A "DELETE" was implemented in order to respect practical implications such as CCPA & GDPR requests
- It can be built upon in order to implement complex Sagas and two phase commits

## Required Software & Tools

1. Docker
2. NodeJs (Frontend & Backend)

## Software Stack

1. RabbitMQ
2. EventStore DB
3. ExpressJs (Backend services)
4. Artillery (Load Testing)

## Services
1. `uuids`: Generates globally unique identifiers that can horizontally scale and are numeric and sortable by time
2. `users`: Manages user accounts

## Stack Setup
1. Install Required Software & Tools
2. In a terminal, run `make up`

## Running Tests

Run `make test` in a terminal after setting up the stack.

**Note**: If you receive ERRCONNRESET responses in your terminal, run `docker restart users` to reboot, and `make logs users` to verify the users service connects to RabbitMQ successfully.
